Assignment: lab 3
Files for this assignment: README, Makefile, and FileReverse.c

FileReverse.c
Same as FileReverse.java in lab 2 but in C. Takes two command line arguments that
give the names of the input and output files respectively. Reads each line of input,
parses the tokens, then prints each token backwards to the output file on a line by
itself. (Combines FileIO.c and pseudocode in lab manual for stringReverse()).

Makefile:
Runs FileReverse.c on a terminal. Compile by typing make -f Makefile (as long as
FileReverse.c is included in the same directory), and then run by typing FileReverse
along with the program arguments.
