Files for this assignment: README, Makefile, and charType.c

charType.c
Reads every line of input file and for each line, displays the number of characters of each
character type and displays these character types in strings in the output file.
(Borrows/modifies code from alphaNum.c.)

Makefile:
Runs charType.c on a terminal. Compile by typing make -f Makefile (as long as
charType.c is included in the same directory), and then run by typing charType
along with the program arguments (the input and output files).
