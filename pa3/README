Makefile:
Runs DictionaryClient on a terminal. Compile by typing make -f Makefile (as long as
DictionaryClient and the other java files are included in the same directory),
and then run by typing DictionaryClient. This Makefile contains wildcards and pattern
substitutions that allow other java files existing in the same directory to be compiled
along with DictionaryClient (the main class).

Dictionary.java:
Implements the Dictionary ADT interface with 7 ADT operations: isEmpty() (checks for empty
dictionary), size() (returns number of items), lookup() (returns value associated with the
argument key), insert() (adds an item to the list), delete() (deletes an item from the list),
makeEmpty() (resets the dictionary to an empty state), and toString() (prints the entire
dictionary). It contains a private class called Node, containing a key (String), a value (String),
and a pointer to the next Node (Node next), which is initially set to null. The constructor for
the Dictionary class sets the head of the list to null and the number of items (numItems) to zero.
Finally, there is a private method called findKey() that returns a reference to the Node
containing its argument key, or returns null if that Node does not exist. It helps for
the implementation of insert(), delete() and lookup().
This file borrows/modifies code from: IntegerList.java

DictionaryInterface.java:
Interface for the Dictionary ADT. No alterations made.

DictionaryTest.java:
Tests the Dictionary ADT operations. Based off of DictionaryClient.java.
Borrows the try-catch code from IntegerListTest.java that allows a program to catch
exceptions but continue running afterwards.

DictionaryClient.java:
Client module for testing Dictionary ADT. Intended to display a certain output stated in
the pa3 lab manual. No alterations made.

KeyNotFoundException.java:
Throws exception if key is unable to be found.
Borrowed from Examples\Lecture\IntegerListADT\ArrayWithExceptionsInterface\ListFullException.java,
subclass of RuntimeException.

DuplicateKeyException.java:
Throws exception if inserting a duplicate key.
Borrowed from Examples\Lecture\IntegerListADT\ArrayWithExceptionsInterface\ListFullException.java,
subclass of RuntimeException.
