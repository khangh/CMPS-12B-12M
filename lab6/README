------------------------------------
Makefile:
Runs ListClient on a terminal. Compile by typing make -f Makefile (as long as
ListClient and the other java files are included in the same directory),
and then run by typing ListClient. This Makefile contains wildcards and pattern
substitutions that allow other java files existing in the same directory to be compiled
along with ListClient (the main class).

List.java:
Implements the List ADT interface with 6 ADT operations: isEmpty() (checks for empty
list), size() (returns number of items), get() (returns item at position index),
add() (adds an item to the list at position index), remove() (deletes an item from position
index), and removeAll() (resets the list to an empty state). Also includes toString()
(prints the entire list) and equals() (compares current list with another).
This file borrows/modifies code from: IntegerList.java, Dictionary.java

ListTest.java:
Tests the Java Generics Linked List implementation.
This file borrows/modifies code from: IntegerListTest.java

ListClient.java:
A test client for the List ADT. Was not altered at all.

ListInterface.java:
Interface for the List ADT. Was not altered at all.

ListIndexOutOfBoundsException.java:
Throws an exception if the argument for the index is not inside
the index's bounds of the list. Used in get(), add(), and remove().
Was not altered at all.
