Recursion.java: Runs five recursive functions, three of which involve reversing an
integer array in different ways, and two that find the array index of the maximum
and minimum elements of the array.

Makefile: Compiles Recursion.java. Do this by typing make -f Makefile in the terminal.
Run by then typing Recursion.
