# CMPS-12B-12M
Labs and programming assignments from CMPS 12B/M, all of which use either Java or C. Taken in Fall Quarter 2016 at UCSC with Charlie McDowell/Patrick Tantalo.

## Class Description
**CMPS 12B: Introduction to Data Structures**

Teaches students to implement common data structures and the algorithms associated with each data structure, through progressively difficult exercises. Topics include big "O" notation; pointers, recursion (induction), and dynamic allocation; linked lists and list processing; stacks, queues, binary trees and binary search trees; simple sorting techniques and simple search techniques. Students will gain a working knowledge of the elements of the Java and C programming languages. Prior experience with Unix is assumed. Prerequisite(s): course 11 or 12A or Computer Engineering 13. Concurrent enrollment in course 12M required.

**CMPS 12M: Data Structures Laboratory**

Complements course 12B, gaining additional competence with a number of important software development tools, languages, and techniques. Included are advanced Unix features and utilities such as grep, find, diff, the shell, and pipes; C programs utilizing I/O, arrays, pointers, and structures; a scripting language to perform simple text and file manipulation; and the make utility. Concurrent enrollment in course 12B required.
