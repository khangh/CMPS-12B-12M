Files for this assignment: README, Makefile, and Search.java

Search.java
Takes at least two command line arguments: the name of the input file that contains
a set of words (each separated by a new line), and at least one target word. The program
searches for the target(s) in a String array that contains the set of words from the input
file. The original respective line numbers for each word in the word array are stored in an
integer array called lineNumber. (Combines/modifies code from mergeSort.java, binarySearch.java,
and lineCount.java).

Makefile:
Runs Search.java on a terminal. Compile by typing make -f Makefile (as long as
Search.java is included in the same directory), and then run by typing Search along with
the program arguments.
